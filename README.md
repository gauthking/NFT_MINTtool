# NFT_MINTtool
<h2>GUI Automation used for MINTING my NFTs on OpenSea</h2>

**DON'T RUN THIS PROJECT AS IT WAS SET TO MATCH MY SCREEN PREFERENCES AND OTHER SETTINGS.**

*Main Purpose of this repository is to get some basic reference and ideas from the code.
So this simple python GUI Automation program was created to MINT my NFTs on OpenSea NFT Marketplace.

*THIS CODE SUCCESSFULLY RAN AND UPLOADED THE 500- ITEMS TO THE OPENSEA MARKETPLACE IN AN OVERALL TIME PERIOD OF 16HRS. Despite of the connection issues which happenned once or twice, there were no issues with the code. *

***THIS REPO CONTAINS 2 .PY FILES in which one is the MINTING TOOL and other file uses the Python PIL library to make unlockable contents for each item of the NFT Collection.***
